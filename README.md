## Find the UFOs!
Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search 
- I created a basic HTML web page starting from the index.html file provided.
- I used the UFO dataset provided to write code that appends a table to my web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. This included columns for date/time, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments.
- I used a date form in my HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
